# Changelog

## Version 1.14.0
### Updates
- Added new setting `config.dataWrangler.panels.displayOnTabFocus` which can optionally disable panels from being shown during startup and on focus.
- Sorting and filtering by the index column is now supported. The index can also be renamed when in editing mode.
- Removed the header text label for default (unmodified) index columns.
- Column insights and summary stats are now shown for user-set index columns.
- Added support for copying cell contents using keyboard shortcuts (ctrl+C or cmd+C).
- Added optimizations for variable import to support different viewing strategies, which should generally improve the layout of the data on import (e.g., support for list of dictionaries, using index orientation for flat dictionaries).
- Added support for PySpark connect DataFrames.
- Derivative DataFrame classes are now supported when Pandas converters exist (e.g., toPandas(), to_pandas(), interchange API).
- Added ability to edit the initial code when importing a variable, similar to how it is possible to edit for file imports.

- Added support for GPU-backed and sparse PyTorch tensors.
- When exporting to CSV, the data index will now be included if it has been changed from the default index (for example if `set_index` has been used).
- Custom operations now use isolated scoping. This means that variables declared in operations are now fully isolated from one another and can be easily undone when the operation is removed.
- Data Wrangler is now supported on local VS Code servers started with `code serve-web`.
- Removed dependency on setuptools. This will remove an extra install step needed for environments that do not have it.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed an issue where backslashes were double-escaped in the code to load data from a file.

## Version 1.2.1
### Bugfixes

## Version 1.0.2
### Updates
- Added support for additional DataFrame types.

## Version 1.0.0
### Updates
- **Web support added! üéâ** Data Wrangler is now supported in the browser for notebook entry points. You can try installing the extension in vscode.dev.
- Added support for viewing data from a notebook while in debugging mode.
- Data Wrangler has a vibrant new icon!
- Data Wrangler is now available in 14 display languages supported by Visual Studio Code.
- The ‚Äúpreview‚Äù label in the extension name and marketplace entry have been removed.
- Changed .NET to be an optional dependency. When attempting to use "by example" operations for the first time, a prompt will be shown to ask users if they want to install .NET. This should lead to a smoother experience for users who are unable to install .NET in certain environments.
- Added the functionality to delete the most recently committed history step, even when a preview is active on it, which can save time by not requiring discarding the step before deletion.
- One-hot encode now generates code to create columns next to the targets instead of at the end. This makes it easier to verify by not having to scroll to the end of the grid to see the new results.
- Updated the cell status bar entrypoint label to: "Open <variable> in Data Wrangler". This makes it easier for new users to discover.
- Statistics are now displayed with greater precision in the summary panel.
- Added a documentation link in input box for setting up JupyterLab kernels. This will help users who are unfamiliar with Jupyter to set up their environment.
- Several experimental features have been upgraded to a stable state and their associated flags in VS Code settings have been removed. These had previously been enabled by default and so should result in no change for most users.
- Error stack traces are now displayed using a VS Code terminal instead of a text editor. This improves color contrast and enables line highlights to be displayed in some cases.
- Added support for Jupyter extension version 2024.3.2024030101 and above.
- Updated the ‚ÄúAuto Detect Csv Delimiter‚Äù experimental setting to be disabled by default.
 
### Accessibility improvements

- Fixed an issue where data loading with nested numpy arrays would crash on load.
- Fixed an issue where an error notification could appear after closing Data Wrangler before it has finished connecting to the runtime.
- Fixed an issue where very large numeric values could lose precision when displayed in the grid or statistics.
- Fixed an issue where the sort and filter commands were available in the command palette even when they should be disabled.
- Fixed an issue where the variable name displayed in the "custom operation" help text could sometimes be incorrect.
- Fixed an issue where one-hot encoding more than one column would not delete all of the original columns.
- Fixed an issue where PyTorch Tensor objects would fail to open in Data Wrangler when opened from a notebook.
- Fixed an issue where notebooks created via export would be unable to open the data viewer without reloading.
- Fixed an issue where the Data Wrangler extension was not being activated for interactive notebooks.


## Version 0.28.0
### Updates
- Progress messages while previewing, undoing, discarding and committing operations now only appear after a short delay. This reduces flickering of notifications when several actions happen in a short time span.
- Added a delayed progress message for the View data toolbar menu item when the kernel is busy to make it clear that there is a pending background task.
 
### Accessibility improvements
- Improved color contrast of various UI controls in some VS Code themes.
- Improved visibility of keyboard focus outlines across the UI.
- The code preview panel will now display the text cursor even when the code is not editable. This enables users to select code more easily using only the keyboard.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed an issue where filter was being re-executed when switching from Editing to Viewing mode with the filters panel open.

## Version 0.26.0
### Updates
- Introducing a data viewing mode for Data Wrangler, which integrates into the Jupyter Notebooks data viewer. The new data viewing mode provides a lightweight and faster experience for quickly viewing, sorting and filtering data. This mode is now the default Data Wrangler entrypoint from the notebook, which can be disabled from setting to default back to the original editing mode. To manually enter this mode, select ‚ÄúViewing‚Äù in the mode toggle in the toolbar.
- The data import step can now be edited like any other step when data has been loaded from a file. Some basic arguments have been added including file path, delimiter, and page # for Excel files.
- Added a confirmation dialog when clicking "Back to all operations" for custom operations to warn potential loss of code.
- Improvements to list and dict variable loading support.
- Clicking on the data shape now also reveals the summary panel.

- Improved screen reader announcements after loading data, accepting/rejecting/undoing operations, and more.
- Improved contrast of various UI elements in some themes.
- Added or fixed ARIA labels, roles, and attributes in several places, including:
  - Tree view in the summary panel
  - Sortable lists in sort, filter, and group by operation arguments
    - Argument fields in sort and filter operations
    - Sort and filter buttons in the grid cells and toolbar
    - And more...

### Bugfixes
- No longer shows the "Open source file in basic editor" button for sessions entered from the notebook as it was always disabled.
- Fixed issue where operations found in the search bar required a double click to select.
- Minor theming fixes.

## Version 0.24.1
### Updates

-   When opening a file in Data Wrangler, a prompt will now offer to configure Data Wrangler as the default editor for all files with that extension.
-   When opening a CSV file in Data Wrangler, the column delimiter is now automatically detected. This enables users to easily open CSV data separated by tabs, semicolons, spaces, etc. This behavior can be disabled from the extension settings.

#### Notebooks
-   The old cell output launch button has been deprecated and removed. It is now replaced with a cell status bar entrypoint using the same launch criteria.
-   The following data types are now also supported: Pandas Series, Lists, Dicts, Tensors.
-   It is now possible to also launch using display(variable_name), print(variable_name) at the end of a cell.

-   Add experimental setting to enable use of newly proposed Jupyter extension APIs for code execution.

#### Operations
-   Added compatibility mode for the Sort and Filter operations to cast unknown data types into the string type. This will allow all columns to be filterable and sortable regardless of the contents.
-   Filter operation now supports a shorthand way to specify additional conditions on the same column.
-   Small performance optimizations for sort, filter and group by and aggregate to skip code execution when adding and deleting groups.

#### Statistics
-   Improved the appearance of visualizations on columns with mixed data.
-   Improve histogram binning for float columns with only integer values.
-   Avoid recalculating column statistics if rows are simply reordered by a custom operation.

#### UX

### Bugfixes
* Fixed an issue where "Sort Descending" was setting the sort order to ascending when invoked from the context menu.

## Version 0.22.1
### Bugfixes
* Fixed an issue where column visualizations could sometimes fail to update when the data changes

### Bugfixes
* Fixed an issue where, in certain scenarios, some loading failures would occur without generating an error message. This fix will facilitate the identification of issues during the startup process.
* For Python packages where the imported name differs from the package name (e.g., import sklearn vs. package name scikit-learn), Data Wrangler now uses the correct package name when suggesting installation. It does this by keeping an internal mapping of import name to package name for the most commonly used Python packages.

## Version 0.20.0
### Updates
* Missing values are now displayed with a different style in the grid.
* Percentages in column statistics now show "<1%" instead of "0%" when the ratio is below 1% but non-zero. Similar behavior applies to ratios between 99% and 100%.
* It is now possible to export code and data without having to first perform operations. This will allow users additional flexibility with generating import code and with exporting into different file formats. Note: when entering Data Wrangler from a notebook, it will still be required to do operations before exporting the code.
* When an operation fails due to a missing package (such as when importing in a custom operation), Data Wrangler will now display a button to quickly install the missing package based on the imported name.

* Fixed an issue in numeric histograms where values lying very close to bucket boundaries could sometimes be placed in the wrong bucket.
* Fixed an issue where the code preview panel would not have a title if moved to a different location in the VS Code UI.
* Fixed issue where overriding definitions from the builtins namespace could cause runtime errors.
* Fixed issue where toolbar overflow behaviour was broken. Menu items now move into an overflow menu when there is not enough space.
* Fixed an issue where the placeholder text in the code preview panel could overflow with no available scrollbar.
* Resize the icon for the "Open in Data Wrangler" button, as it was getting cut off in recent versions of VS Code.

## Version 0.18.0
### Updates
* Added new "Go to column" button to reveal and smoothly scroll to a target column in the grid.

### Bugfixes
* Fixed issue where data frames with duplicate index keys could not be properly viewed or wrangled. Please note for this scenario that there are some limitations with generating the diff previews, these are outlined [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-data-wrangler/wiki/Known-Issues#pandas-dataframes-with-duplicate-index-keys).

## Version 0.14.0
### Updates
* Added support for exporting data in the Parquet format. The users can enable this option in the settings, and the feature will be enabled by default on a future version.
* Improvements to column visualizations including adjustments to accessibility labels and improved formatting of tooltip contents.

### Bugfixes
* Fixed an issue where Data Wrangler was expanding all VS Code panels (bottom panel and sidebars) even when the Data Wrangler tab was being unfocused.
* Fixed an issue where the wrong column would sometimes be selected for operations when columns are dynamically disabled (e.g., Fill NA).

## Version 0.12.0
### Updates

### Bugfixes
* Fixed an issue where errors may not be caught in some cases when using IPython version 8.12.1 or above.

## Version 0.8.0
### Updates:
* In "Find and replace" operation, surface a form field error if the "Old value" field is left empty.
* Improve readability of code example in code editor placeholder text by showing `df = df.drop(columns=['ColumnName'])` instead of `df = drop('ColumnName', axis=1)`.
* Removed the `inplace=True` and `copy=False` parameters from generated pandas code, as those aren't considered best practice and [are being considered for deprecation](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/51466) in Pandas.
* Improved support for all VS Code themes.

### Bugfixes:
* In "Find and replace" operation, preserve the contents of fields "Old value" and "New value" when "Target columns" is changed.
